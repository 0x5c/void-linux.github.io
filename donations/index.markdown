# Help the project with a donation!

Maintaining a complete package system and a distribution takes a lot of time. Void is a project
developed entirely by volunteers, i.e developers don't get paid when contributing changes or
features. Maintaining a domain, as well as build servers costs money, therefore if you are using
void or xbps, and you like it, please consider making a donation to help the project to continue further.

The funds will be used for hardware, maintainability and domain costs, and if the quantity permits it
there will be organized events, as well as feature bounties or alike.

Please click on the icons above to support us! currently we support donations via **Flattr**,
 **Patreon** and **PayPal**.
