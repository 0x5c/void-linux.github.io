The latest and greatest GNOME major version is now available for the Void distribution.

It took me some hours to update all packages to achieve a complete GNOME 3.12 desktop.

Remember that updating a distribution is time consuming and if you appreciate the work
to have the latest and greatest software available before any other distribution, please
help me with donations and/or contributing with updates, wiki, etc.
