We're proud to announce that yet again we are the first and currently only Linux
distribution that ships [LibreSSL-2.3](http://www.libressl.org/) by default.

In the last two days we rebuilt the whole package index with the latest stable
release of LibreSSL. The process took more than 24 hours and needed several
fixes to various packages. There are still some packages, that link against
the older LibreSSL-2.2 but the will go away within a few days.

Report any issues and thanks for using VoidLinux!
