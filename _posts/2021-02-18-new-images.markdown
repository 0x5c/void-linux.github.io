We're pleased to announce that the 20210218 image set has been
promoted to current and is now generally available.

You can find the new images on our [downloads page](/download/) and on
our many [mirrors](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/index.html).

Special thanks for this image set goes out to @ericonr for work in
validating the images, and to @paper42 for providing us a new image in
the grub splash screen.
