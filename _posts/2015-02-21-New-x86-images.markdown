New x86 (32/64 bits) ISO live images are now available for public consumption.
All images (including the minimal one with **base-system**) now include the following
software:

- cryptsetup
- lvm2
- mdadm

Additionally there's now an additional flavour containing the latest [Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/)
Desktop Environment.

Check out the [Download](http://www.voidlinux.eu/download/) section to grab them.
